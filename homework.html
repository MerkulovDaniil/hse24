<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linear-algebra-basics">Linear algebra basics</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>[10 points] Prove that the matrix <span class="math inline">xy^T</span> has rank equals to one.</p></li>
<li><p>[20 points] Find SVD of the following matrices:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">A = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\2\\3 \end{bmatrix}</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 4\\4 &amp; 8\\3 &amp; 8 \end{bmatrix}</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0\\x &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}</span>, where <span class="math inline">x</span> is the sum of your birthdate numbers (day + month)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[10 points] Assume we have a set of data points <span class="math inline">x^{(i)}\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\,i=1,\dots,m</span>, and decide to represent this data as a matrix</p>
<p><span class="math display">
X =
     \begin{pmatrix}
     | &amp; &amp; | \\
     x^{(1)} &amp; \dots &amp; x^{(m)} \\
     | &amp; &amp; | \\
     \end{pmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}.
</span></p>
<p>We suppose that <span class="math inline">\text{rank}\,X = r</span>.</p>
<p>In the problem below, we ask you to find the rank of some matrix <span class="math inline">M</span> related to <span class="math inline">X</span>. In particular, you need to find relation between <span class="math inline">\text{rank}\,X = r</span> and <span class="math inline">\text{rank}\,M</span>, e.g., that the rank of <span class="math inline">M</span> is always larger/smaller than the rank of <span class="math inline">X</span> or that <span class="math inline">\text{rank}\,M = \text{rank}\,X \big / 35</span>. Please support your answer with legitimate arguments and make the answer as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>Note that depending on the structure of the matrix <span class="math inline">X</span>, border cases are possible. Make sure to cover them in your answer correctly.</p>
<p>In applied statistics and machine learning, data is often normalized. One particularly popular strategy is to subtract the estimated mean <span class="math inline">\mu</span> and divide by the square root of the estimated variance <span class="math inline">\sigma^2</span>. i.e.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
x \rightarrow (x - \mu) \big / \sigma.
</span></p>
<p>After the normalization, we get a new matrix</p>
<p><span class="math display">
     \begin{split}
     Y &amp;:=
     \begin{pmatrix}
         | &amp; &amp; | \\
         y^{(1)} &amp; \dots &amp; y^{(m)} \\
         | &amp; &amp; | \\
     \end{pmatrix},\\
     y^{(i)} &amp;:= \frac{x^{(i)} - \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x^{(i)}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} \left(x^{(i)}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x^{(i)}\right)^2}}.
     \end{split}
</span></p>
<p>What is the rank of <span class="math inline">Y</span> if <span class="math inline">\text{rank} \; X = r</span>?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Image Compression with Truncated SVD</strong> [10 points] Explore image compression using Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Understand how varying the number of singular values affects the quality of the compressed image. Implement a Python script to compress a grayscale image using Truncated SVD and visualize the compression quality.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Truncated SVD</strong>: Decomposes an image <span class="math inline">A</span> into <span class="math inline">U, S,</span> and <span class="math inline">V</span> matrices. The compressed image is reconstructed using a subset of singular values.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematical Representation</strong>: <span class="math display">
A \approx U_k \Sigma_k V_k^T
</span>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">U_k</span> and <span class="math inline">V_k</span> are the first <span class="math inline">k</span> columns of <span class="math inline">U</span> and <span class="math inline">V</span>, respectively.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\Sigma_k</span> is a diagonal matrix with the top <span class="math inline">k</span> singular values.</li>
<li><strong>Relative Error</strong>: Measures the fidelity of the compressed image compared to the original.</li>
</ul>
<span class="math display">
  \text{Relative Error} = \frac{\| A - A_k \|}{\| A \|}

<p>In this assignment, you will modify an existing Python code for gradient descent to include various line search conditions. You will test these modifications on two functions: a quadratic function and the Rosenbrock function. The main objectives are to understand how different line search strategies influence the convergence of the gradient descent algorithm and to compare their efficiencies based on the number of function evaluations.</p>

<p>Due to commercial agreements with Lyzard Corp has to deliver at least 4500 headphone covers and 4000 laptop covers per week to strengthen the product’s diffusion.</p>
<p>The marketing department estimates that the weekly demand for headphones covers, phone, and laptop covers does not exceed 10000 14000, and 7000 units, therefore the company does not want to produce more than these amounts for headphones, phone, and laptop covers.</p>
<p>Finally, the net profit per headphone cover, phone cover, and laptop cover are $5, $7, and $12, respectively.</p>
<p>The aim is to determine a weekly production schedule that maximizes the total net profit.</p>

<li><p><strong>Convergence of Gradient Descent in non-convex smooth case</strong> [10 points]</p>
<p>We will assume nothing about the convexity of <span class="math inline">f</span>. We will show that gradient descent reaches an <span class="math inline">\varepsilon</span>-substationary point <span class="math inline">x</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\|\nabla f(x)\|_2 \leq \varepsilon</span>, in <span class="math inline">O(1/\varepsilon^2)</span> iterations.

<ul>
<li><p>Plug in <span class="math inline">y = x^{k+1} = x^{k} - \alpha \nabla f(x^k), x = x^k</span> to (<a href="#eq-quad_ub" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;1</a>) to show that</p>

</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>How gradient descent convergence depends on the condition number and dimensionality.</strong> [20 points] Investigate how the number of iterations required for gradient descent to converge depends on the following two parameters: the condition number <span class="math inline">\kappa \geq 1</span> of the function being optimized, and the dimensionality <span class="math inline">n</span> of the space of variables being optimized.</p>
<p>To do this, for given parameters <span class="math inline">n</span> and <span class="math inline">\kappa</span>, randomly generate a quadratic problem of size <span class="math inline">n</span> with condition number <span class="math inline">\kappa</span> and run gradient descent on it with some fixed required precision. Measure the number of iterations <span class="math inline">T(n, \kappa)</span> that the method required for convergence (successful termination based on the stopping criterion).</p>
<p>Recommendation: The simplest way to generate a random quadratic problem of size <span class="math inline">n</span> with a given condition number <span class="math inline">\kappa</span> is as follows. It is convenient to take a diagonal matrix <span class="math inline">A \in S_{n}^{++}</span> as simply the diagonal matrix <span class="math inline">A = \text{Diag}(a)</span>, whose diagonal elements are randomly generated within <span class="math inline">[1, \kappa]</span>, and where <span class="math inline">\min(a) = 1</span>, <span class="math inline">\max(a) = \kappa</span>. As the vector <span class="math inline">b \in \mathbb{R}^n</span>, you can take a vector with random elements. Diagonal matrices are convenient to consider since they can be efficiently processed with even for large values of <span class="math inline">n</span>.</p>
<p>Fix a certain value of the dimensionality <span class="math inline">n</span>. Iterate over different condition numbers <span class="math inline">\kappa</span> on a grid and plot the dependence of <span class="math inline">T(n,\kappa)</span> against <span class="math inline">\kappa</span>. Since the quadratic problem is generated randomly each time, repeat this experiment several times. As a result, for a fixed value of <span class="math inline">n</span>, you should obtain a whole family of curves showing the dependence of <span class="math inline">T(n, \kappa)</span> on <span class="math inline">\kappa</span>. Draw all these curves in the same color for clarity (for example, red).</p>
<p>Now increase the value of <span class="math inline">n</span> and repeat the experiment. You should obtain a new family of curves <span class="math inline">T(n',\kappa)</span> against <span class="math inline">\kappa</span>. Draw all these curves in the same color but different from the previous one (for example, blue).</p>
<p>Repeat this procedure several times for other values of <span class="math inline">n</span>. Eventually, you should have several different families of curves - some red (corresponding to one value of <span class="math inline">n</span>), some blue (corresponding to another value of <span class="math inline">n</span>), some green, etc.</p>
<p>Note that it makes sense to iterate over the values of the dimensionality <span class="math inline">n</span> on a logarithmic grid (for example, <span class="math inline">n = 10, n = 100, n = 1000</span>, etc.). Use the following stopping criterion: <span class="math inline">\|\nabla f(x_k)\|_2^2 \leq \varepsilon \|\nabla f(x_0)\|_2^2</span> with <span class="math inline">\varepsilon = 10^{-5}</span>. Select the starting point <span class="math inline">x_0 = (1, \ldots, 1)^T</span></p>
<p>What conclusions can be drawn from the resulting picture?</p></li>

</ol>
<p>Context: this counterexample was provided in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.3595.pdf">paper</a>, while the global convergence of the heavy ball method for general smooth strongly convex function was introduced in another <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7457.pdf">paper</a>. Recently, it was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11291.pdf">suggested</a>, that the heavy-ball (HB) method provably does not reach an accelerated convergence rate on smooth strongly convex problems.</p></li>
<li><p>[40 points] In this problem we will work with accelerated methods applied to the logistic regression problem. A good visual introduction to the topic is available <a href="https://mlu-explain.github.io/logistic-regression/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Logistic regression is a standard model in classification tasks. For simplicity, consider only the case of binary classification. Informally, the problem is formulated as follows: There is a training sample <span class="math inline">\{(a_i, b_i)\}_{i=1}^m</span>, consisting of <span class="math inline">m</span> vectors <span class="math inline">a_i \in \mathbb{R}^n</span> (referred to as features) and corresponding numbers <span class="math inline">b_i \in \{-1, 1\}</span> (referred to as classes or labels). The goal is to construct an algorithm <span class="math inline">b(\cdot)</span>, which for any new feature vector <span class="math inline">a</span> automatically determines its class <span class="math inline">b(a) \in \{-1, 1\}</span>.</p>
<p>In the logistic regression model, the class determination is performed based on the sign of the linear combination of the components of the vector <span class="math inline">a</span> with some fixed coefficients <span class="math inline">x \in \mathbb{R}^n</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
b(a) := \text{sign}(\langle a, x \rangle).
</span></p>
<p>The coefficients <span class="math inline">x</span> are the parameters of the model and are adjusted by solving the following optimization problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\tag{LogReg}
\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \ln(1 + \exp(-b_i \langle a_i, x \rangle)) + \frac{\lambda}{2} \|x\|^2 \right),
</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\lambda \geq 0</span> is the regularization coefficient (a model parameter).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Will the LogReg problem be convex for <span class="math inline">\lambda = 0</span>? What is the gradient of the objective function? Will it be strongly convex? What if you will add regularization with <span class="math inline">\lambda &gt; 0</span>?</p></li>
<li><p>We will work with the real-world data for <span class="math inline">A</span> and <span class="math inline">b</span>: take the mushroom dataset. Be careful, you will need to predict if the mushroom is poisonous or edible. A poor model can cause death in this exercise.</p>

Note, that for the problem above we have the matrix <span class="math inline">\hat{A}^T \hat{A}</span> and the condition number is squared after this operation (<span class="math inline">\kappa (X^T X) =  \kappa^2 \left(X \right)</span>). That is the reason, why we typically need to use <em>preconditioners</em> (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake-papers/painless-conjugate-gradient.pdf">read 12. for more details</a>) with CG.</p>
<p>The general idea of using preconditioners implies switchwing from solving <span class="math inline">Ax = b</span> to <span class="math inline">MAx = Mb</span> with hope, that <span class="math inline">\kappa \left( MA\right) \ll \kappa \left( A\right)</span> or eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">MA</span> are better clustered than those of <span class="math inline">A</span> (note, that matrix <span class="math inline">A</span> here is for the general case, here we have <span class="math inline">\hat{A}^T\hat{A}</span> instead).</p>
<p>This idea can also be viewed as coordinate change <span class="math inline">x = T \hat{x}, \; \hat{x} = T^{-1}x</span>, which leads to the problem <span class="math inline">T^T A T \hat{x} = T^Tb</span>. Note, that the spectrum of <span class="math inline">T^TAT</span> is the same as the spectrum of <span class="math inline">MA</span>.</p>
<p>The best choice of <span class="math inline">M</span> is <span class="math inline">A^{-1}</span>, because <span class="math inline">\kappa (A^{-1} A) = \kappa (I) = 1</span>. However, if we know <span class="math inline">A^{-1}</span>, the original problem is already solved, that is why we need to find some trade-off between enhanced convergence, and extra cost of working with <span class="math inline">M</span>. The goal is to find <span class="math inline">M</span> that is cheap to multiply, and approximate inverse of <span class="math inline">A</span> (or at least has a more clustered spectrum than <span class="math inline">A</span>).</p>
<p>Note, that for the linear least squares problem the matrix of quadratic form is <span class="math inline">A = \hat{A}^T\hat{A}</span>. Below you can find Vanilla CG algorithm (on the left) and preconditioned CG algorithm (on the right):</p>

<p><em>Hadamard matrix</em></p>
<p>Given <span class="math inline">m \in \{2^i, i = 1, 2, \ldots\}</span>, the (unnormalized) Hadamard matrix of order <span class="math inline">m</span> is defined recursively as</p>
<p><span class="math display">
H_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \text{and} \quad H_m = \begin{bmatrix} H_{m/2} &amp; H_{m/2} \\ H_{m/2} &amp; -H_{m/2} \end{bmatrix}.
</span></p>
<p>The associated normalized Hadamard matrix is given by <span class="math inline">H^{(\text{norm})}_m = \frac{1}{\sqrt{m}} H_m</span>, which evidently satisfies <span class="math inline">H^{(\text{norm})T}_m H^{(\text{norm})}_m = I_{m \times m}</span>. Moreover, via a recursive algorithm, it is possible to compute matvec <span class="math inline">H_m x</span> in time <span class="math inline">O(m \log m)</span>, which is much faster than <span class="math inline">m^2</span> for a general matrix.</p>
<p>To solve the least squares minimization problem using conjugate gradients, we must solve <span class="math inline">\hat{A}^T \hat{A} x = \hat{A}^T b</span>. Using a preconditioner <span class="math inline">M</span> such that <span class="math inline">M \approx A^{-1}</span> can give substantial speedup in computing solutions to large problems.</p>
<p>Consider the following scheme to generate a randomized preconditioner, assuming that <span class="math inline">m = 2^i</span> for some <span class="math inline">i</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">S = \text{diag}(S_{11}, \ldots, S_{mm})</span>, where <span class="math inline">S_{jj}</span> are random <span class="math inline">\{-1,+1\}</span> signs</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">p \in \mathbb{Z}^+</span> be a small positive integer, say <span class="math inline">20</span> for this problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">R \in \{0, 1\}^{n+p \times m}</span> be a <em>row selection matrix</em>, meaning that each row of <span class="math inline">R</span> has only 1 non-zero entry, chosen uniformly at random. (The location of these non-zero columns is distinct.)</p>

<li><p><strong>(4 poins)</strong> Suppose that conjugate gradients runs for <span class="math inline">k</span> iterations. Using the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm with <span class="math inline">M = (\hat{A}^T \Phi^T \Phi \hat{A})^{-1}</span>, how many total floating point operations have been performed? How many would be required to directly solve <span class="math inline">\hat{A}^T \hat{A} x = \hat{A}^T b</span>? How large must <span class="math inline">k</span> be to make the conjugate gradient method slower?</p></li>

<li><p>[20 points] <strong>Proximal Method for Sparse Softmax Regression</strong> Softmax regression, also known as multinomial logistic regression, is a generalization of logistic regression to multiple classes. It is used to model categorical outcome variables where each category is mutually exclusive. The softmax function transforms any input vector to the probability-like vector as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
P(y = j | x; W) = \frac{e^{W_j^T x}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{c} e^{W_i^T x}}
</span></p>

</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">x</span> is the input vector, <span class="math inline">W</span> is the weight matrix, <span class="math inline">c</span> is the number of classes, and <span class="math inline">P(y = j | x; W)</span> is the probability that the input <span class="math inline">x</span> belongs to class <span class="math inline">j</span>.</p>
<p>The optimization problem for softmax regression is to minimize the negative log-likelihood:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\min_{W \in \mathbb{R}^{c \times d}} -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \log P(y_i | x_i; W) + \lambda \| W \|_1
</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">N</span> is the number of training examples, <span class="math inline">\lambda</span> is the regularization parameter, and <span class="math inline">\| W \|_1</span> is the L1 norm of the weight matrix, which promotes sparsity in the solution. I suggest you to vectorize matrix and add <span class="math inline">1</span>-vector norm.</p>
<p>We will solve the sparse softmax regression problem using the subgradient method and the proximal gradient method, both incorporating L1 regularization. The proximal gradient method is particularly useful for optimization problems involving non-smooth regularizers like the L1 norm. We will use 3 class classification problem of <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success">Predicting Students’ Dropout and Academic Success</a>. In this problem you should start with this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/MerkulovDaniil/optim/blob/master/assets/Notebooks/Proximal_softmax_regression.ipynb">colab notebook</a></p>

<li>[4 points] Write down exact formulation of subgradient method and proximal gradient method here (you can not use any optimization problems in this formulation).</li>
<li>[6 points] Choose <span class="math inline">\lambda = 0</span>. Solve the softmax regression problem using subgradient descent and proximal gradient descent. Find the highest learning (individually), acceptable for both methods to converge. Note, that if method assumes monotonic convergence - you have to choose appropriate learning rate to fullfill it.

<li><p><strong>😱 Newton convergence issue</strong> (10 points)</p>
<p>Consider the following function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
f(x,y) = \dfrac{x^4}{4} - x^2 + 2x + (y-1)^2
</span></p>
<p>And the starting point is <span class="math inline">x_0 = (0,2)^\top</span>. How does Newton’s method behave when started from this point? How can this be explained? How does the gradient descent with fixed step <span class="math inline">\alpha = 0.01</span> and the steepest descent method behave under the same conditions? (It is not necessary to show numerical simulations in this problem).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hessian-Free Newton method</strong> (20 points) In this exercise, we’ll explore the optimization of a binary logistic regression problem using various methods. Don’t worry about the size of the problem description, first 5 bullets out of 7 could be done pretty quickly. In this problem you should start with this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/MerkulovDaniil/optim/blob/master/assets/Notebooks/Hessian_free_Newton.ipynb">colab notebook</a></p>
<p>Given a dataset with <span class="math inline">n</span> observations, where each observation consists of a feature vector <span class="math inline">x_i</span> and an associated binary target variable <span class="math inline">y_i \in \{0,1\}</span>, the logistic regression model predicts the probability that <span class="math inline">y_i = 1</span> given <span class="math inline">x_i</span> using the logistic function. The loss function to be minimized is the negative log-likelihood of the observed outcomes under this model, summed across all observations. It has a high value when the model outputs differ significantly from the data <span class="math inline">y</span>.</p>
<p>The binary cross-entropy loss function for a single observation <span class="math inline">(x_i, y_i)</span> is given by: <span class="math display">
\text{Loss}(w; x_i, y_i) = -\left[ y_i \log(p(y_i=1 | x_i; w)) + (1-y_i) \log(1-p(y_i=1 | x_i; w)) \right]
</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">p(y=1 | x;w)</span> is defined as: <span class="math display">
p(y=1 | x;w) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-w^T x}}
</span></p>
<p>To define the total loss over the dataset, we sum up the individual losses: <span class="math display">
f(w) = -\sum_{i=1}^n \left[ y_i \log(p(y_i=1 | x_i; w)) + (1-y_i) \log(1-p(y_i=1 | x_i; w)) \right]
</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the optimization problem in logistic regression is: <span class="math display">
\min_w f(w) = \min_w -\sum_{i=1}^n \left[ y_i \log\left(p\left(y_i=1 | x_i; w\right)\right) + \left(1-y_i\right) \log\left(1-p(y_i=1 | x_i; w)\right) \right]
</span></p>
<p>This is a convex optimization problem and can be solved using gradient-based methods such as gradient descent, Newton’s method, or more sophisticated optimization algorithms often available in machine learning libraries. However, it is the problem is often together with <span class="math inline">l_2</span> regularization:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\min_w f(w) = \min_w -\sum_{i=1}^n \left[ y_i \log\left(p\left(y_i=1 | x_i; w\right)\right) + \left(1-y_i\right) \log\left(1-p(y_i=1 | x_i; w)\right) \right] + \frac{\mu}{2} \|w\|_2^2
</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>(2 points) Firstly, we address the optimization with Gradient Descent (GD) in a strongly convex setting, with <span class="math inline">\mu = 1</span>.

<li><p>(2 points) What can you say about Newton’s method convergence in the same setting <span class="math inline">\mu=0</span>? Try several learning rates smaller, than <span class="math inline">1</span> for the damped Newton method. Does it work? Write your conclusions about the second-order method convergence for a binary logistic regression problem.</p></li>
<li><p>(5 points) Now switch back to the strongly convex setting <span class="math inline">\mu=1</span>. To avoid directly computing the Hessian matrix in Newton’s method, use the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method to solve the linear system in the Newton step. Develop the <code>newton_method_cg</code> function, which computes the Newton step using CG to solve the system <span class="math inline">\nabla^2 f(x_k) d_k = - \nabla f(x_k), \; x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha d_k</span> defined by the Hessian. You have to use <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.scipy.sparse.linalg.cg.html"><code>jax.scipy.sparse.linalg.cg</code></a> function here. So, firstly compute the hessian as it was done in the code, then put it into this linear solver. Compare its performance in terms of computational efficiency and convergence rate to the standard Newton method.</p></li>
<li><p>(5 points) Finally, implement a Hessian-free version of Newton’s method (HFN) which utilizes Hessian-vector products derived via automatic differentiation. Note, that <code>jax.scipy.sparse.linalg.cg</code> function can take the matvec function, which directly produces the multiplication of any input vector <span class="math inline">x</span>. Implement the HFN method without explicitly forming or storing the Hessian matrix in function <code>newton_method_hfn</code>. Use autograd to compute Hessian-vector products as it is described <a href="https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2024/blog/bench-hvp/">here</a>. Compare this method’s time complexity and memory requirements against previous implementations.</p></li>

<pre><code>We will train the model to reconstruct normal data and when the reconstruction error for the actual data on trained model is high, we report an anomaly. Start with this notebook [\faPython colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MerkulovDaniil/optim/blob/master/assets/Notebooks/time_series_anomaly.ipynb). The default solution is adam and after training it can detect 4 out of 5 anomalies. Train and compare several methods on the same problem. For each method try to find hyperparameters, which ensures at least 3 out of 5 anomalies detection. Present learning curves and anomaly predictions for each method.

<li><p><strong>Fit the largest model you can on a single GPU.</strong> [20 points]</p>
<p>In this assignment, you will train a language model (LM) using the TinyStories dataset, focusing on optimizing model performance within the constraints of Google Colab’s hardware. For the sake of speed, we will do it on the part of the dataset.</p>
<pre class="tiny_stories"><code>Once upon a time, there was a little car named Beep. Beep loved to go fast and play in the sun. 
Beep was a healthy car because he always had good fuel....</code></pre>
<p>Your objective is to maximize the size of the model without exceeding the available computational resources (~ 16GB VRAM). You could start with the Hugging Face Transformers library and experiment with various memory optimization techniques, such as (but not limited to):</p>
<pre><code> * Different batch size
 * Different optimizer
 * Gradient accumulation
 * Activation checkpointing
 * CPU offloading
 * 8bit optimizers</code></pre>
<p>You have a baseline of training <code>gpt-2</code> model prepared at the following <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/MerkulovDaniil/optim/blob/master/assets/Notebooks/TinyStories_baseline.ipynb">colab notebook</a>. You can easily switch it to <code>opt-350m</code>, <code>opt-1.3b</code>, <code>gpt2</code> etc. You can find a great beginner-level guide on the topic <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.18.0/en/performance">here</a>.</p>
<pre class="gpt2"><code>A long time ago in a galaxy far far away... a little girl named Lily was playing in the garden. She was so excited! She wanted to explore the garden and see what was around her.
Suddenly, she heard a loud noise. Lily looked up and saw a big, hairy creature. Lily was so excited! She ran to the creature and grabbed it by the arm. The creature was so big and hairy that Lily couldn't help but laugh. </code></pre>

<p>For each unique trick for memory optimization, you will get 4 points (maximum 20 points). A combination of tricks is not counted as a unique trick, but will, probably, be necessary to train big models. The maximum grade is bounded with the size of the trained model: * If the model size you train is &lt;= 125M - you can get a maximum of 8 points. * If the model size you train is 126M &lt;= 350M - you can get a maximum of 12 points. * If the model size you train is 350M &lt;= 1B - you can get a maximum of 16 points. * If you fit 1B model or more - you can get a maximum 20 points.</p></li>
