# Line search

## Problem

Suppose, we have a problem of minimization of a function $f(x): \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ of scalar variable:

$$
f(x) \to \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}}
$$

. . .

Sometimes, we refer to the similar problem of finding minimum on the line segment $[a,b]$:

$$
f(x) \to \min_{x \in [a,b]}
$$

. . .


:::{.callout-example}
Typical example of line search problem is selecting appropriate stepsize for gradient descent algorithm:

$$
\begin{split}
x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha \nabla f(x_k) \\
\alpha = \text{argmin } f(x_{k+1}) 
\end{split}
$$

:::

. . .


The line search is a fundamental optimization problem that plays a crucial role in solving complex tasks. To simplify the problem, let's assume that the function, $f(x)$, is *unimodal*, meaning it has a single peak or valley.

## Unimodal function

:::{.callout-definition}
Function $f(x)$ is called **unimodal** on $[a, b]$, if there is $x_* \in [a, b]$, that $f(x_1) > f(x_2) \;\;\; \forall a \le x_1 < x_2 < x_*$ and $f(x_1) < f(x_2) \;\;\; \forall x_* < x_1 < x_2 \leq b$
:::

. . .


![Examples of unimodal functions](unimodal.pdf)

## Key property of unimodal functions

Let $f(x)$ be unimodal function on $[a, b]$. Than if $x_1 < x_2 \in [a, b]$, then:

* if $f(x_1) \leq f(x_2) \to x_* \in [a, x_2]$
* if $f(x_1) \geq f(x_2) \to x_* \in [x_1, b]$

. . .

**Proof** Let's prove the first statement. On the contrary, suppose that $f(x_1) \leq f(x_2)$, but $x^* > x_2$. Then necessarily $x_1 < x_2 < x^*$ and by the unimodality of the function $f(x)$ the inequality: $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$ must be satisfied. We have obtained a contradiction.

## Dichotomy method


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
We aim to solve the following problem:

$$
f(x) \to \min_{x \in [a,b]}
$$

We divide a segment into two equal parts and choose the one that contains the solution of the problem using the values of functions, based on the key property described above. Our goal after one iteration of the method is to halve the solution region.

## Dichotomy method. Algorithm

```python
def binary_search(f, a, b, epsilon):
    c = (a + b) / 2
    while abs(b - a) > epsilon:
        y = (a + c) / 2.0
        if f(y) <= f(c):
            b = c
            c = y
        else:
            z = (b + c) / 2.0
            if f(c) <= f(z):
                a = y
                b = z
            else:
                a = c
                c = z
    return c
```

## Dichotomy method. Bounds
The length of the line segment on $k+1$-th iteration:

$$
\Delta_{k+1} = b_{k+1} - a_{k+1} = \dfrac{1}{2^k}(b-a)
$$


. . .



For unimodal functions, this holds if we select the middle of a segment as an output of the iteration $x_{k+1}$: 

$$
|x_{k+1} - x_*| \leq \dfrac{\Delta_{k+1}}{2} \leq \dfrac{1}{2^{k+1}}(b-a) \leq (0.5)^{k+1} \cdot (b-a)
$$


. . .



Note, that at each iteration we ask oracle no more, than 2 times, so the number of function evaluations is $N = 2 \cdot k$, which implies:

$$
|x_{k+1} - x_*| \leq (0.5)^{\frac{N}{2}+1} \cdot (b-a) \leq  (0.707)^{N}  \frac{b-a}{2}
$$

. . .


By marking the right side of the last inequality for $\varepsilon$, we get the number of method iterations needed to achieve $\varepsilon$ accuracy:

$$
K = \left\lceil \log_2 \dfrac{b-a}{\varepsilon} - 1 \right\rceil
$$

## Golden selection
The idea is quite similar to the dichotomy method. There are two golden points on the line segment (left and right) and the insightful idea is, that on the next iteration one of the points will remain the golden point.

![Key idea, that allows us to decrease function evaluations](golden_search.pdf)

## Golden selection. Algorithm

```python
def golden_search(f, a, b, epsilon):
    tau = (sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    y = a + (b - a) / tau**2
    z = a + (b - a) / tau
    while b - a > epsilon:
        if f(y) <= f(z):
            b = z
            z = y
            y = a + (b - a) / tau**2
        else:
            a = y
            y = z
            z = a + (b - a) / tau
    return (a + b) / 2
```

## Golden selection. Bounds

$$
|x_{k+1} - x_*| \leq b_{k+1} - a_{k+1} = \left( \frac{1}{\tau} \right)^{N-1} (b - a) \approx 0.618^k(b-a),
$$

where $\tau = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$.

* The geometric progression constant **more** than the dichotomy method - $0.618$ worse than $0.5$
* The number of function calls **is less** than for the dichotomy method - $0.707$ worse than $0.618$ - (for each iteration of the dichotomy method, except for the first one, the function is calculated no more than 2 times, and for the gold method - no more than one)

## Successive parabolic interpolation

Sampling 3 points of a function determines unique parabola. Using this information we will go directly to its minimum. Suppose, we have 3 points $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$ such that line segment $[x_1, x_3]$ contains minimum of a function $f(x)$. Then, we need to solve the following system of equations:

. . .


$$
ax_i^2 + bx_i + c = f_i = f(x_i), i = 1,2,3 
$$

Note, that this system is linear, since we need to solve it on $a,b,c$. Minimum of this parabola will be calculated as:

. . .


$$
u = -\dfrac{b}{2a} = x_2 - \dfrac{(x_2 - x_1)^2(f_2 - f_3) - (x_2 - x_3)^2(f_2 - f_1)}{2\left[ (x_2 - x_1)(f_2 - f_3) - (x_2 - x_3)(f_2 - f_1)\right]}
$$

Note, that if $f_2 < f_1, f_2 < f_3$, than $u$ will lie in $[x_1, x_3]$

## Successive parabolic interpolation. Algorithm [^2]

\scriptsize
```python
def parabola_search(f, x1, x2, x3, epsilon):
    f1, f2, f3 = f(x1), f(x2), f(x3)
    while x3 - x1 > epsilon:
        u = x2 - ((x2 - x1)**2*(f2 - f3) - (x2 - x3)**2*(f2 - f1))/(2*((x2 - x1)*(f2 - f3) - (x2 - x3)*(f2 - f1)))
        fu = f(u)

        if x2 <= u:
            if f2 <= fu:
                x1, x2, x3 = x1, x2, u
                f1, f2, f3 = f1, f2, fu
            else:
                x1, x2, x3 = x2, u, x3
                f1, f2, f3 = f2, fu, f3
        else:
            if fu <= f2:
                x1, x2, x3 = x1, u, x2
                f1, f2, f3 = f1, fu, f2
            else:
                x1, x2, x3 = u, x2, x3
                f1, f2, f3 = fu, f2, f3
    return (x1 + x3) / 2
```


[^2]: The convergence of this method is superlinear, but local, which means, that you can take profit from using this method only near some neighbour of optimum. [*Here*](https://people.math.sc.edu/kellerlv/Quadratic_Interpolation.pdf) is the proof of superlinear convergence of order $1.32$.



## Inexact line search

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Sometimes it is enough to find a solution, which will approximately solve out problem. This is very typical scenario for mentioned stepsize selection problem

$$
\begin{split}
x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha \nabla f(x_k) \\
\alpha = \text{argmin } f(x_{k+1}) 
\end{split}
$$

. . .


Consider a scalar function $\phi(\alpha)$ at a point $x_k$: 

$$
\phi(\alpha) = f(x_k - \alpha\nabla f(x_k)), \alpha \geq 0
$$

. . .


The first-order approximation of $\phi(\alpha)$ near $\alpha = 0$ is:

$$
\phi(\alpha) \approx f(x_k) - \alpha\nabla f(x_k)^\top \nabla f(x_k)
$$

## Inexact line search. Sufficient Decrease

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
The inexact line search condition, known as the Armijo condition, states that $\alpha$ should provide sufficient decrease in the function $f$, satisfying:

$$
f(x_k - \alpha \nabla f (x_k)) \leq f(x_k) - c_1 \cdot \alpha\nabla f(x_k)^\top \nabla f(x_k)
$$

. . .


for some constant $c_1 \in (0,1)$. Note that setting $c_1 = 1$ corresponds to the first-order Taylor approximation of $\phi(\alpha)$. However, this condition can accept very small values of $\alpha$, potentially slowing down the solution process. Typically, $c_1 \approx 10^{-4}$ is used in practice.

. . .


:::{.callout-example}
If $f(x)$ represents a cost function in an optimization problem, choosing an appropriate $c_1$ value is crucial. For instance, in a machine learning model training scenario, an improper $c_1$ might lead to either very slow convergence or missing the minimum.

## Inexact line search. Goldstein Conditions


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Consider two linear scalar functions $\phi_1(\alpha)$ and $\phi_2(\alpha)$:

$$
\phi_1(\alpha) = f(x_k) - c_1 \alpha \|\nabla f(x_k)\|^2
$$

$$
\phi_2(\alpha) = f(x_k) - c_2 \alpha \|\nabla f(x_k)\|^2
$$

. . .


The Goldstein-Armijo conditions locate the function $\phi(\alpha)$ between $\phi_1(\alpha)$ and $\phi_2(\alpha)$. Typically, $c_1 = \rho$ and $c_2 = 1 - \rho$, with $\rho \in (0.5, 1)$.

## Inexact line search. Curvature Condition


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
To avoid excessively short steps, we introduce a second criterion:

$$
-\nabla f (x_k - \alpha \nabla f(x_k))^\top \nabla f(x_k) \geq c_2 \nabla f(x_k)^\top(- \nabla f(x_k))
$$

. . .


for some $c_2 \in (c_1,1)$. Here, $c_1$ is from the Armijo condition. The left-hand side is the derivative $\nabla_\alpha \phi(\alpha)$, ensuring that the slope of $\phi(\alpha)$ at the target point is at least $c_2$ times the initial slope $\nabla_\alpha \phi(\alpha)(0)$. Commonly, $c_2 \approx 0.9$ is used for Newton or quasi-Newton methods. Together, the sufficient decrease and curvature conditions form the Wolfe conditions.

## Backtracking Line Search

Backtracking line search is a technique to find a step size that satisfies the Armijo condition, Goldstein conditions, or other criteria of inexact line search. It begins with a relatively large step size and iteratively scales it down until a condition is met.

. . .


### Algorithm:

1. Choose an initial step size, $\alpha_0$, and parameters $\beta \in (0, 1)$ and $c_1 \in (0, 1)$.
2. Check if the chosen step size satisfies the chosen condition (e.g., Armijo condition).
3. If the condition is satisfied, stop; else, set $\alpha := \beta \alpha$ and repeat step 2.

. . .


The step size $\alpha$ is updated as 

$$
\alpha_{k+1} := \beta \alpha_k
$$

in each iteration until the chosen condition is satisfied.

:::{.callout-example}
In machine learning model training, the backtracking line search can be used to adjust the learning rate. If the loss doesn't decrease sufficiently, the learning rate is reduced multiplicatively until the Armijo condition is met.

    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} \\
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2} \\
    \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}

. . .


named gradient of $f(x)$. This vector indicates the direction of the steepest ascent. Thus, vector $-\nabla f(x)$ means the direction of the steepest descent of the function in the point. Moreover, the gradient vector is always orthogonal to the contour line in the point.

$$
This gradient points in the direction of the steepest ascent of the function.

## Hessian

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

Let $f(x):\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, then matrix, containing all the second order partial derivatives:

$$
f''(x) = \nabla^2 f(x) = \dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} = \begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} & \dots  & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1\partial x_n} \\
    \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_2} & \dots  & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_n} \\

\end{pmatrix}
$$

. . .


In fact, Hessian could be a tensor in such a way: $\left(f(x): \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m \right)$ is just 3d tensor, every slice is just hessian of corresponding scalar function $\left( \nabla^2f_1(x), \ldots, \nabla^2f_m(x)\right)$.

## Schwartz theorem

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a function. If the mixed partial derivatives $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}$ and $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_j \partial x_i}$ are both continuous on an open set containing a point $a$, then they are equal at the point $a$. That is,
$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} (a) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_j \partial x_i} (a)
$$

. . .


Given the Schwartz theorem, if the mixed partials are continuous on an open set, the Hessian matrix is symmetric. That means the entries above the main diagonal mirror those below the main diagonal:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_j \partial x_i} \quad \nabla^2 f(x)  =(\nabla^2 f(x))^T
$$

This symmetry simplifies computations and analysis involving the Hessian matrix in various applications, particularly in optimization.

## Schwartz counterexample
$$
f(x,y) = 
\begin{cases}
    \frac{xy\left(x^2 - y^2\right)}{x^2 + y^2} & \text{ for } (x,\, y) \ne (0,\, 0),\\
    0 & \text{ for } (x, y) = (0, 0).
\end{cases}
$$

**Counterexample [$\clubsuit$](https://fmin.xyz/docs/theory/Matrix_calculus.html#hessian)**

![](schwartz.pdf)

One can verify, that $\frac{\partial^2 f}{ \partial x \partial y} (0, 0) \neq \frac{\partial^2 f}{ \partial y \partial x} (0, 0)$, although the mixed partial derivatives do exist, and at every other point the symmetry does hold.

## Jacobian

The extension of the gradient of multidimensional $f(x):\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$ is the following matrix:

$$
J_f = f'(x) = \dfrac{df}{dx^T} = \begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} & \dots  & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} \\
    \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2} & \dots  & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_2} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_n} & \dots  & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Let $x \in S$ be an interior point of the set $S$, and let $D : U \rightarrow V$ be a linear operator. We say that the function $f$ is differentiable at the point $x$ with derivative $D$ if for all sufficiently small $h \in U$ the following decomposition holds: 
$$ 
f(x + h) = f(x) + D[h] + o(\|h\|)
$$
If for any linear operator $D : U \rightarrow V$ the function $f$ is not differentiable at the point $x$ with derivative $D$, then we say that $f$ is not differentiable at the point $x$.
:::

## Differentials

After obtaining the differential notation of $df$ we can retrieve the gradient using the following formula:

$$
df(x) = \langle \nabla f(x), dx\rangle
$$

. . .


Then, if we have a differential of the above form and we need to calculate the second derivative of the matrix/vector function, we treat "old" $dx$ as the constant $dx_1$, then calculate $d(df) = d^2f(x)$

$$
d^2f(x) = \langle \nabla^2 f(x) dx_1, dx\rangle = \langle H_f(x) dx_1, dx\rangle
$$

## Differential properties

Let $A$ and $B$ be the constant matrices, while $X$ and $Y$ are the variables (or matrix functions).

1.  It is essential for $A$ to be positive definite, because it is a logarithm argument. So, $A \in \mathbb{S}^n_{++}$Let's find the differential first: 
$$
\begin{split}
    df &= d \left( \ln \langle x, Ax\rangle \right) = \dfrac{d \left( \langle x, Ax\rangle \right)}{ \langle x, Ax\rangle} = \dfrac{\langle dx, Ax\rangle +  \langle x, d(Ax)\rangle}{ \langle x, Ax\rangle} = \\
    &= \dfrac{\langle Ax, dx\rangle + \langle x, Adx\rangle}{ \langle x, Ax\rangle} = \dfrac{\langle Ax, dx\rangle + \langle A^T x, dx\rangle}{ \langle x, Ax\rangle} = \dfrac{\langle (A + A^T) x, dx\rangle}{ \langle x, Ax\rangle} 
\end{split}
$$
2.  Note, that our main goal is to derive the form $df = \langle \cdot, dx\rangle$
$$
df = \left\langle  \dfrac{2 A x}{ \langle x, Ax\rangle} , dx\right\rangle
$$
Hence, the gradient is $\nabla f(x) = \dfrac{2 A x}{ \langle x, Ax\rangle}$

# Automatic differentiation

## Problem

Suppose we need to solve the following problem:

$$
L(w) \to \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d}
$$
. . .



Such problems typically arise in machine learning, when you need to find optimal hyperparameters $w$ of an ML model (i.e. train a neural network). You may use a lot of algorithms to approach this problem, but given the modern size of the problem, where $d$ could be dozens of billions it is very challenging to solve this problem without information about the gradients using zero-order optimization algorithms. That is why it would be beneficial to be able to calculate the gradient vector $\nabla_w L = \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}, \ldots, \frac{\partial L}{\partial w_d}\right)^T$. Typically, first-order methods perform much better in huge-scale optimization, while second-order methods require too much memory.

## Finite differences

The naive approach to get approximate values of gradients is **Finite differences** approach. For each coordinate, one can calculate the partial derivative approximation:

$$
\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_k} (w) \approx \dfrac{L(w+\varepsilon e_k) - L(w)}{\varepsilon}, \quad e_k = (0, \ldots, \underset{{\tiny k}}{1}, \ldots, 0)
$$

:::{.callout-question}
If the time needed for one calculation of $L(w)$ is $T$, what is the time needed for calculating $\nabla_w L$ with this approach?

** Answer ** $2dT$, which is extremely long for the huge scale optimization. Moreover, this exact scheme is unstable, which means that you will have to choose between accuracy and stability.

## Forward mode automatic differentiation

To dive deep into the idea of automatic differentiation we will consider a simple function for calculating derivatives: 

$$
L(w_1, w_2) = w_2 \log w_1 + \sqrt{w_2 \log w_1}
$$

Let's draw a *computational graph* of this function:

![Illustration of computation graph of primitive arithmetic operations for the function $L(w_1, w_2)$](comp_graph.pdf)

. . .


Let's go from the beginning of the graph to the end and calculate the derivative $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}$.

Suppose, we have a computational graph $v_i, i \in [1; N]$. Our goal is to calculate the derivative of the output of this graph with respect to some input variable $w_k$, i.e. $\dfrac{\partial v_N}{\partial w_k}$. This idea implies propagation of the gradient with respect to the input variable from start to end, that is why we can introduce the notation: 

$$
\overline{v_i} = \dfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial w_k}
$$

![Illustration of forward chain rule to calculate the derivative of the function $L$ with respect to $w_k$.](auto_diff_forward.pdf)

* For $i = 1, \ldots, N$:
    * Compute $v_i$ as a function of its parents (inputs) $x_1, \ldots, x_{t_i}$:
        $$
        v_i = v_i(x_1, \ldots, x_{t_i})
        $$
    * Compute the derivative $\overline{v_i}$ using the forward chain rule:
        $$
        \overline{v_i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{t_i}\dfrac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j}\dfrac{\partial x_j}{\partial w_k}
        $$

. . .


Note, that this approach does not require storing all intermediate computations, but one can see, that for calculating the derivative $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_k}$ we need $\mathcal{O}(T)$ operations. This means, that for the whole gradient, we need $d\mathcal{O}(T)$ operations, which is the same as for finite differences, but we do not have stability issues, or inaccuracies now (the formulas above are exact).

## Backward mode automatic differentiation

We will consider the same function with a computational graph:

![Illustration of computation graph of primitive arithmetic operations for the function $L(w_1, w_2)$](comp_graph.pdf)

. . .


Assume, that we have some values of the parameters $w_1, w_2$ and we have already performed a forward pass (i.e. single propagation through the computational graph from left to right). Suppose, also, that we somehow saved all intermediate values of $v_i$. Let's go from the end of the graph to the beginning and calculate the derivatives $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}, \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}$:

Note, that for the same price of computations as it was in the forward mode we have the full vector of gradient $\nabla_w L$. Is it a free lunch? What is the cost of acceleration?

:::{.callout-answer collapse="true"}
Note, that for using the reverse mode AD you need to store all intermediate computations from the forward pass. This problem could be somehow mitigated with the gradient checkpointing approach, which involves necessary recomputations of some intermediate values. This could significantly reduce the memory footprint of the large machine-learning model.
